JSON question: where is it, is it a file?

It’s not a file in your theme folder.

It’s a Customizer field stored in WordPress database.

Where to edit it

WP Admin → Appearance → Customize → Home (CMS)
Look for:

Sponsors (JSON list) (or similar label)

Recognition (JSON list)

That’s where you paste the JSON.

How to add “more”

Just paste more items into that JSON list. No coding, no folder edits.

Example (Sponsors JSON list):

[
  {"src":"https://apl.local/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/logo1.png","url":"https://example.com"},
  {"src":"https://apl.local/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/logo2.png"},
  {"src":"https://apl.local/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/logo3.png"},
  {"src":"https://apl.local/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/logo4.png"},
  {"src":"https://apl.local/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/logo5.png"}
]


To get the image URL easily:

WP Admin → Media → Library

Click image → copy the File URL
